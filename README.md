 Autolooter for Necrotic Runes and Scourgestones

This a replacement addon for Necrotic Rune Autoloot. I decided to split off into a different project so that this addon can expand beyond autolooting invasions. 


Currently, this addon has the following features:

- Auto-need Necrotic Runes & Invader Scourgestones 
- Bypass BOP prompts
- Fast Loot

Usage:

-  Type /cks to open a menu to configure the addon.
